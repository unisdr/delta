### 4. Installing DTS as Country Instance

1. Clone the repo with the command 'git clone git@github.com:unisdr/dts-deployment-unog.git'. The folder name for this repository must be "dts-deployment-unog".
```bash
git clone git@github.com:unisdr/dts-deployment-unog.git
```
2. Build the container images by running 'docker-compose build'.
```bash
docker-compose build
```
3. Build the production code artifact by running './build.sh'.
```bash
./build.sh
```
4. Create the environment variables from file example.env to .env.
```bash
cp ./example.env ./.env
```
5. Update the database by running './db-update.sh'.
