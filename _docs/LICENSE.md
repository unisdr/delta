# UNDRR Disaster Tracking System (DTS) â€“ License (Draft Under Review)

## License Status  
This software is an open source platform developed by UNDRR for country-level disaster tracking systems. The licensing model is currently under evaluation to ensure alignment with the needs of country-level deployments, open-source community engagement, and compatibility with included dependencies.

The two primary options under consideration are:
- **MIT License**
- **Apache License 2.0**

The final selection will be based on compatibility, legal clarity, and alignment with similar open-source projects across the UN system.

## License Goals  
Whichever license is selected, it must:
- Allow countries to deploy and customize their own DTS instances  
- Enable contributions from the open-source community  
- Ensure legal clarity around third-party dependencies  
- Maintain permissive terms while protecting the integrity of the platform  

## Third-Party Dependency Overview  
The DTS platform includes multiple third-party components, each governed by permissive open-source licenses:

| Dependency        | License         |
|-------------------|------------------|
| React             | MIT              |
| Remix             | MIT              |
| TypeScript        | Apache 2.0       |
| PostgreSQL        | PostgreSQL       |
| UNDP Icon Set     | MIT              |
| Other Libraries   | MIT / Apache 2.0 |

These licenses are generally compatible with both MIT and Apache 2.0 options. They:
- Allow reuse in commercial or proprietary systems  
- Require attribution but no source disclosure (non-copyleft)  
- Impose minimal legal restrictions  

## Country-Level Deployment Terms  
Each country instance may be subject to local terms and conditions. The selected license will include clear guidance for:
- Customization rights  
- Redistribution of modified versions  
- Contribution pathways back to the main codebase  

## Important Notes (Pre-Finalization)
- This file is a draft pending final license selection.  
- Use of this platform is subject to UNDRR authorization until the license is finalized.  
- Final documentation will reflect the selected license and attribution obligations.  
- Contributors should follow guidance in the [CONTRIBUTING.md] TODO once published.

## Next Steps  
- Legal review of MIT vs Apache 2.0 licenses  
- Approval of final license by project stakeholders  
- Publication of definitive LICENSE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files
