# UNDRR Disaster Tracking System (DTS) - Digital Public Goods Standard Compliance Matrix

## Executive Summary

The UNDRR Disaster Tracking System (DTS) is a comprehensive platform designed to support country-level disaster tracking and management. This document assesses DTS's compliance with the Digital Public Goods (DPG) Standard version 1.1.4, which establishes the baseline requirements for recognition as a digital public good.

**Current Compliance Status**: DTS is **partially compliant** with the DPG Standard, meeting 5 out of 9 indicators fully, with 4 indicators requiring additional actions to achieve full compliance.

**Overall Compliance Score**: 67% (6/9 indicators fully or partially compliant)

**Key Strengths**:
- Strong relevance to SDGs (particularly SDG 11 and 13)
- Well-documented architecture and technical implementation
- Clear platform independence
- Strong adherence to privacy and applicable laws
- Robust "do no harm" design principles

**Primary Gaps**:
- Pending license implementation (recommended Apache License 2.0)
- Incomplete documentation for country-level deployment
- Limited data extraction mechanisms for non-technical users
- Incomplete documentation of standards compliance

This matrix provides a roadmap for achieving full DPG compliance, with prioritized action items and target completion dates to support DTS's application to the DPG Registry.

## DPG Standard Overview

The Digital Public Goods Standard is a set of specifications and guidelines designed to determine whether a digital solution conforms to the definition of a digital public good as established by the UN Secretary-General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. According to this definition, digital public goods must be:

1. Open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, or open content
2. Adhere to privacy and applicable best practices
3. Do no harm by design
4. Demonstrate relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals

The DPG Standard consists of 9 indicators that establish the baseline requirements for recognition as a digital public good:

1. **Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals**
2. **Use of Approved Open Licenses**
3. **Clear Ownership**
4. **Platform Independence**
5. **Documentation**
6. **Mechanism for Extracting Data and Content**
7. **Adherence to Privacy and Applicable Laws**
8. **Adherence to Standards & Best Practices**
9. **Do No Harm By Design**
   - 9a) Data Privacy & Security
   - 9b) Inappropriate & Illegal Content
   - 9c) Protection from Harassment

The UNDRR Disaster Tracking System directly contributes to the following Sustainable Development Goals:

## SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **Target 11.5**: By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations.
- **Target 11.b**: By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels.

## SDG 13: Climate Action
- **Target 13.1**: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.
- **Target 13.3**: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.
