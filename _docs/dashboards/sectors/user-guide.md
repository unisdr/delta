## Overview

The Sectors Analytics Dashboard helps you analyze how disasters impact different parts of your country's economy. The dashboard shows you damages, losses, and other effects from natural disasters across various sectors like agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. **Log into the system** with your authorized account
2. **Navigate to Analytics** from the main menu
3. **Select Sectors Analysis** to access the dashboard
4. **Apply filters** to see relevant data for your analysis

### Understanding Your Data

The dashboard only shows data that belongs to your country account. This means:
- You see disasters that occurred in your country
- Geographic areas are limited to your administrative divisions
- Currency values are displayed in your configured currency
- Sector classifications match your country's structure

## Dashboard Sections

### 1. Impact on Selected Sector

### Filter Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with main categories, then add specific filters
2. **Required filters**: You must select at least one sector to see any data
3. **Clear filters**: Use the "Clear" button to reset all selections
4. **Apply changes**: Click "Apply Filters" to update all visualizations

## Step-by-Step Workflows

### Analyzing Sector Vulnerability

**Objective**: Understand which disasters pose the greatest threat to a specific sector

**Steps**:
1. Select your sector of interest (e.g., Agriculture)
2. Review the "Impact on Selected Sector" summary
3. Check "Impact by Hazard Type" to see which disasters are most problematic
4. Use the geographic map to identify vulnerable regions
5. Review "Effect Details" for specific impact information

### Comparing Time Periods

**Objective**: Compare disaster impacts between different years or periods

**Steps**:
1. Apply filters for your first time period
2. Note the total damages and losses
3. Clear filters and apply filters for your second time period
4. Compare the results
5. Use the timeline charts to see trends over time

### Geographic Risk Assessment

**Objective**: Identify which areas of your country face the highest disaster risk

**Steps**:
1. Select a broad sector or leave unfiltered for overall impact
2. Go to the geographic impact map
3. Switch between damage and loss views
4. Identify the darkest-colored regions
5. Click on high-impact areas for detailed information

### Event-Specific Analysis

**Objective**: Understand the impact of a specific disaster event

**Steps**:
1. Use the disaster event search to find your specific event
2. Select the event from the search results
3. Apply the filter to see data for only that event
4. Review all dashboard sections to understand the full impact
5. Use geographic map to see spatial distribution of impacts

## Understanding the Data

### What the Numbers Mean

**Damages**: 
- Physical destruction to buildings, equipment, and infrastructure
- Calculated as the cost to repair or replace damaged items
- Shown in your country's configured currency

**Losses**: 
- Disruptions to economic activity and additional costs
- Includes lost production, increased costs, and service interruptions
- Also shown in your country's configured currency

**Events**: 
- Individual disaster occurrences that caused recorded impacts
- Each event may affect multiple sectors and geographic areas

### Data Quality Indicators

**"No Data Available"**: 
- Information not recorded in the system for selected criteria
- Try broadening your filters or different time periods

**"Zero Impact (Confirmed)"**: 
- Data shows definitively that no impact occurred
- Different from missing data - this is a confirmed zero

**Loading indicators**: 
- Data is being retrieved and processed
- Complex filters may take longer to process

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Data Appears
- **Check your filters**: Ensure they're not too restrictive
- **Verify time range**: Try expanding your date range
- **Confirm sector selection**: Make sure you've selected a sector
- **Try broader filters**: Start with fewer filters and add more gradually

### Map Doesn't Load
- **Check internet connection**: Maps require online access
- **Verify geographic data**: Your country account may need geographic boundaries configured
- **Try different sectors**: Some sectors may have more geographic data than others

### Slow Performance
- **Narrow your filters**: Broad queries take longer to process
- **Reduce date ranges**: Shorter time periods load faster
- **Try specific sectors**: Analyzing all sectors takes more time

### Empty Results
- **Check data availability**: Your country may not have data for the selected criteria
- **Verify filter combinations**: Some filter combinations may not have any matching records
- **Contact administrator**: If you expect data but see none, your data may need to be published

## Best Practices

### Effective Analysis Workflows

**Start with Overview**:
1. Begin without filters to see overall country impact
2. Review which sectors are most affected
3. Identify time periods with highest activity
4. Then apply specific filters for detailed analysis

**Use Progressive Filtering**:
1. Start with broad categories (main sectors, hazard types)
2. Gradually add more specific filters
3. Observe how each filter changes the results
4. Document interesting findings as you go

**Cross-Reference Sections**:
1. Use multiple dashboard sections together
2. Compare geographic patterns with hazard types
3. Verify findings across different visualizations
4. Look for consistent patterns in the data

### Data Interpretation Guidelines

**Understanding Scale**:
- Large numbers may be abbreviated (e.g., $2.4B for $2.4 billion)
- Percentages in pie charts show relative importance
- Timeline charts help identify trends and patterns

**Comparing Results**:
- Use consistent time periods when comparing sectors
- Consider population and economic size when interpreting geographic results
- Look at both frequency (event count) and severity (damage amounts)

**Identifying Priorities**:
- High-damage, high-frequency combinations indicate priority areas
- Geographic clustering may suggest systematic vulnerabilities
- Recent trends may indicate emerging risks

4. Compare different time periods using date filters
5. Look for seasonal or cyclical patterns

**Expected insights**: Understanding of changing risk patterns and trends

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Understanding Data Coverage

**Complete vs Partial Data**:
- Some events may have complete damage assessments
- Others may have partial or estimated data
- Missing data doesn't necessarily mean no impact occurred

**Geographic Coverage**:
- Data availability may vary by region
- Urban areas often have more detailed assessments
- Remote areas may have limited damage reporting

**Sector Coverage**:
- Some sectors may have more comprehensive data collection
- Government-managed sectors often have better reporting
- Private sector impacts may be underreported

### Using Data Responsibly

**For Planning**:
- Use trends and patterns rather than exact figures for planning
- Consider data limitations when making major decisions
- Combine dashboard insights with other information sources

**For Reporting**:
- Always specify the time period and filters used
- Note any data limitations in your analysis
- Include context about data collection methods

**For Decision Making**:
- Use dashboard data as one input among many
- Verify critical findings with additional sources
- Consider consulting disaster risk experts for major decisions
